# Stock analysis - Challenge

## Macro presentation

The tab "All Stocks Analysis' of the Excel file "green_stocks_Challenge.xlsm" contains one refactored macro "All_Stock_Analysis_Refactored()" under module 2 which allows to return ticker's daily volume exchanged and yearly returns. A related input button has been created for convenience (named "Run refactored Analysis for All Stocks").

**NB:** 
- The analysis is limited to information gathered on tabs 2017 and 2018 and results are limited to the first 12 found in theses tabs.
- Users could select the year targeted upon starting the macro
- If additional tabs/years are required, data format should match the ones in tabs "2017" and "2018" and will need the macro to be updated.
- Previous non-optimized macro "All_Stock_Analysis()" (also under Module 2) has been kept to show improvements of the refactored macro. It is also linked with a button (named "Run Analysis for All Stocks").

## Data analysis (limited to year 2018)
On the 12 tickers analyzed, only two had a positive return for the year 2018. Both returns are huge and these tickers should be the most "go and invest" ones.
